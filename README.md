# Fan_Controller_System
Overview
This project aims to design a temperature-controlled fan system using the ATmega32 microcontroller. The system monitors temperature using the LM35 temperature sensor, converts analog readings to digital values using the ADC, and controls a fan's speed based on predefined temperature thresholds. The project follows a layered architecture, with separate drivers for various components.
